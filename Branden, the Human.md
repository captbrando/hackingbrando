# Branden, the Human
Hi there < PARTNER >, welcome to our team. You are going to be a great addition to < COMPANY >! 

We're a complex organization, and it will easily take you six months to begin to figure out how this place works, and possibly nine to really hit your stride and be as effective as you want. Everyone here was the new kid once. You should meet all of your peers in my organization as well as other orgs, and meet my peers and our leadership team. Ask questions, take notes, learn how they work. Understand how you may soon add value and learn our lingo. Yes, we sure do use a LOT of acronyms around here.

As you come up to speed, we need to define how you and I will work. I've created this handy user guide on me and how I work (intended to accelerate our working relationship), inspired/borrowed heavily upon by fantastic work from [@Rands](https://twitter.com/rands/). This is a living document, which is why it's here on Github. After reading this, you will learn what you can expect out of a typical week, how I like to work, what my guiding principles are, and the things that make me, well, ME. 

## The Average Week

You and I will plan on a 1:1 every week for at least 30 minutes. This is your meeting, not mine. I would prefer we discuss topics of substance, not just updates. I'm sure we will both be guilty of asking for updates on things while we are talking, but we can get those updates via IM, text, or by including them in the meeting invite just as easily. I'd prefer to tackle bigger subjects during our 1:1s. 

We will also have a weekly staff meeting with our team including your peers. This meeting is designed to be a mix of tactical touch points with substantive topics that affect most or all of the team. We may include guest speakers or other people outside our direct team that support what we do. Similar to 1:1s, we aren’t discussing status at this meeting, but issues of substance that affect the whole team. If we have a large project bringing us together, we may leverage that space for our meeting to avoid meeting fatigue.

You can message me at any time. I will respond as quickly as I am able. I also read all my email and work to get close to *Inbox Zero* every week. I am not tied to my inbox and tend to process in batches. If you need me to look at something quickly, message me to get my attention. 

I like emails [written with military precision](https://hbr.org/2016/11/how-to-write-email-with-military-precision?autocomplete=true). Not all my emails will look like this. If I am trying to get an executive's attention, I follow this format. If you want to get my attention, you should follow it too.

If I am traveling, I will let you know. We will keep our meetings, noting I may need to adjust based on my current time zone. 

I do typically work a little bit on the weekend. This is my choice. **I do not expect you to work on the weekend, UNLESS we are doing validations for a production deployment.** I might email or text you, but unless I let you know it's urgent, it can always wait until work begins for you on Monday. 

## Guiding Principles

**Humans first.** I believe that happy, informed, and productive humans harmonize well with our partners, customers, and stakeholders. I like working with humans, and I like making humans successful. 

**Leadership comes from everywhere.** You don't need a title to lead. I believe in Robert Quinn's [Fundamental State of Leadership](https://hbr.org/2005/07/moments-of-greatness-entering-the-fundamental-state-of-leadership). My favorite people are those who **collaboratively** contribute their knowledge, personality, and skills to a task at hand.

**Escalation is sometimes required,** and should be done to elevate critical issues. Do it when someone is not doing their job or you see a big risk, not just to get your way.

**Executives are busy, be clear with asks.** The best employees are those that make their manager's job easier. When you go to an executive, make sure you have clearly summarized the issue you are bringing to them, provided solutions with a recommendation or plan forward, and do it without writing hundreds of words.

**I like constant improvement, this is called *kaizen (改善)*.** I break complex systems down into components to understand them. When I see large or small inefficiencies in systems, I’d like to fix them with your help.

**A certain amount of process is healthy.** I like efficient, predictable outcomes with low variability. This stems from my consulting days where I led large teams performing complex work. I needed to ensure that Consultant A would give the same result that Consultant B would give—even when separated by an ocean. Inefficient, excess, manual, or non-value-add process drives me crazy.

**Everyone deserves to be treated fairly.** I believe that most humans try to do the right thing, but unconscious bias leads them astray. I work hard to understand and address my biases because I understand their ability to create inequity. I expect that if I exhibit a [form of bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases) that you will tell me. You should expect the same from me.

**I like action.** Long meetings where we debate potential options are often valuable, but I believe starting is the best way to begin learning and make progress. At some point, we all have to take a step to move toward a goal. I know this will annoy those who like to debate.

**I believe in the technical debt snowball effect of continually fixing small things.** Just like the old andon cords on the Toyota Production Line, fixing problems in the present will save massive time in the future. There are always bugs that can be fixed.

**I assume everyone has good intentions.** I'm also a glass half full guy and always try to find something positive when bad things happen. 

**Conflict can be productive** when conflicting or differing ideas are exchanged in a way where everyone feels equally heard, respected, and unafraid to voice a dissenting opinion. We won't always agree, but my goal is to reach a mutually comfortable resolution (even if we disagree).

## Feedback Protocol

I like feedback. I like to both give and receive. It helps to create closed-loop communication. 

At < COMPANY >, there is a formal, semi-annual feedback cycle. We set our goals annually, but we review and adjust half way through the year. I will send you information on my goals as well as expectations for what you should prepare for your goals. You will draft your goals and we will review in one of our 1:1s. Alignment is important. You should expect that your goals align with mine, which will align with our BU and company goals. While we review your goals, I’ll ask for feedback on my performance.

Review periods are not the only time we’ll exchange feedback. This will be a recurring topic in our 1:1s. I am going to ask you for feedback in 1:1s regularly. I am never going to stop doing this no matter how many times you say you have no feedback for me.

Disagreement is ok. We will learn to efficiently disagree with each other and trust and respect each other more. Ideas don’t get better when everyone is in agreement. 

## Escalation Protocol

Sometimes we will run into a brick wall when trying to accomplish a task. Over the years, I have learned a few things about how this occurs.

* **My priority may not be in line with your priority.** Things important to me may not be important to you, and vice versa. Conflict with other groups often stems from misaligned goals and priorities. 
* **Escalation is not for getting your way.** However, it can be a tool to highlight broken process or organizational dysfunction that is not in line with the overall goals.

## Meeting Protocol

There is never a shortage of meetings. I can't remember a job that didn't have major demands on my calendar. I sometimes get double and triple (or worse) booked. I will also block time in the morning for me to get actual work done. I do my best work in the morning.

I believe that meetings work best when they include an agenda (or an intended purpose), an appropriate amount of productive attendees (not too many and not without key participants), and one accountable person running the meeting to a schedule. Meetings should end with clearly defined action items (what's the next step with names and dates) and communication points for participants (what did we accomplish with our time?). 

I like meetings that start on time and end early enough for me to get to my next meeting on time. If I will be late, I will do my best to let you know. Sometimes meetings run long. I will try not to let that impact your meeting.

I will read materials before the meeting to prepare myself and have any questions ready. If I haven’t read the materials, I will tell you. 

If a meeting completes its intended purpose before it’s scheduled to end, let's end early. If it’s clear the intended goal won’t be achieved in the allotted time, let’s stop the meeting before time is up and determine how to finish the meeting later.

## Nuance and Errata

**I am analytical**, which means that I ask lots of questions and want to understand your point of view. If you make an assertion, be prepared to back it up with data. [Weasel words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weasel_word) make me believe you didn't do your research and are operating on gut instinct.

**Humans stating opinions as facts** are a trigger for me. I appreciate reputable references.

**When I ask you to do something that feels poorly defined** you should ask me to clarify. Sometimes I jump ahead without fully explaining myself. Questions can save us all time and effort. 

**I have trust issues with numbers that don't look real or don't add up,** which means that I may often ask you to show your work like your third grade math teacher did. It's not for partial credit, it's so I can understand how you got to those numbers.

**Ask assertive versus tell assertive.** When you need to ask me to do something, ask me. I respond incredibly well to ask assertiveness (“Branden, can you help with < TASK >?”). I respond poorly to being told what to do (“Branden, do < TASK >”). Unless there is an imminent threat to life and property, in which case, feel free to tell me to move.

**Sometimes I talk a lot.** It's because I get excited and love to exchange ideas. I'm learning to pause and check-in with others. When I get really excited, I sometimes swear. I don't mind some salty language, but I will avoid using it in formal settings.

**If I am on my phone during a meeting for more than 30 seconds, prompt me with a question.** Sometimes my attention wanders, but I can bring it back super quick. 

**This document is a [living, breathing thing](https://github.com/captbrando)** and is not yet complete. I will update it frequently and would appreciate your feedback.
