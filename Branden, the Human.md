# Branden, the Human
Hi there < PARTNER >, welcome to our team. You are going to be a great addition to < COMPANY >!

We're a complex organization, and it will easily take you six months to begin to figure out how this place works, and possibly nine to really hit your stride and be as effective as you want. Everyone here was the new kid once. You should meet all of your peers in my organization as well as other orgs, and meet my peers and our leadership team. Ask questions, take notes, learn how they work. Understand how you may soon add value and learn our lingo. Yes, we sure do use a LOT of acronyms around here.

As you come up to speed, we need to define how you and I will work. I've created this handy user guide on me and how I work (intended to accelerate our working relationship), inspired/borrowed heavily upon by fantastic work from [@Rands](https://randsinrepose.com). The audience of this guide is primarily those working directly with me, however, it's a useful guide for anyone. Some things will not apply to everyone; for example, weekly 1:1s.

This is a living document, which is why it's here on Github. After reading this, you will learn what you can expect out of a typical week, how I like to work, what my guiding principles are, and the things that make me, well, ME.

## The Average Week

You and I will plan on a 1:1 every week for at least 30 minutes. If you want to move this to every other week once we get into a good flow, I'm happy to do this. This is *your* meeting, not mine. I would prefer we discuss topics of substance, not just updates. I'm sure we will both be guilty of asking for updates on things while we are talking, but we can get those updates via IM (Slack/Teams), text, or by including them in the meeting invite just as easily. I'd prefer to tackle bigger subjects during our 1:1s.

We will also touch with the team weekly (including your peers). This meeting is designed to be a mix of tactical touch points with substantive topics that affect most or all of the team. We may include guest speakers or other people outside our direct team that support what we do. Similar to 1:1s, we aren’t discussing status at this meeting, but issues of substance that affect the whole team. If we have a large project bringing us together, we may leverage that space for our meeting to avoid meeting fatigue.

You can message me at any time. I will respond as quickly as I am able. I also read all my email and work to get close to *Inbox Zero* every week. I am not tied to my inbox and generally process it in batches. If you need me to look at something quickly, message me to get my attention.

I like [precisely written emails](https://hbr.org/2016/11/how-to-write-email-with-military-precision?autocomplete=true). Not all my emails will look like this. If I am trying to get an executive's attention, I follow this format. If you want to get my attention, you should follow it too.

If I am traveling, I will let you know. We will keep our meetings, noting I may need to adjust based on my current time zone.

I do typically work a little bit on the weekend. This is my choice. **I do not expect you to work on the weekend, UNLESS your role requires you to perform tasks during those times.** I might email or text you, but unless I let you know it's urgent, it can always wait until work begins for you at the beginning of your work week (generally Monday, but Sunday in other areas of the globe).

## Guiding Principles

**Humans first.** I believe that happy, informed, and productive humans harmonize well with our partners, customers, and stakeholders. I like working with humans, and I like making humans successful.

**Leadership comes from everywhere.** You don't need a title to lead. I believe in Robert Quinn's [Fundamental State of Leadership](https://hbr.org/2005/07/moments-of-greatness-entering-the-fundamental-state-of-leadership). My favorite people are those who **collaboratively** contribute their knowledge, personality, and skills to a task at hand.

**Be directly responsible** for the work you do. Set your own success criteria, be ready to explain decisions (and be open to disagreements), know the next action (with a name and date), and own it (i.e., [you've got the monkey](https://hbr.org/1999/11/management-time-whos-got-the-monkey)).

**Escalation is sometimes required,** and should be done to elevate critical issues. Do it when someone is not doing their job or you see a big risk, not just to get your way.

**Executives are busy, be clear with asks.** The best employees are those that make their manager's job easier. When you go to an executive, make sure you have clearly summarized the issue you are bringing to them, provided solutions with a recommendation or plan forward, and do it without writing hundreds of words.

**I like constant improvement, this is called *kaizen (改善)*.** I break complex systems down into components to understand them. When I see inefficiencies in systems, I’d like to fix them with your help.

**A certain amount of process is healthy.** I like efficient, predictable outcomes with low variability. This stems from my consulting days where I led large teams performing complex work. I needed to ensure that Consultant A would give the same result that Consultant B would give—even when separated by an ocean. Inefficient, excess, manual, or non-value-add process drives me crazy.

**Everyone deserves to be treated fairly.** I believe that most humans try to do the right thing, but unconscious bias leads them astray. I work hard to understand and address my biases because I understand their ability to create inequity. I expect that if I exhibit a [form of bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases) that you will tell me. You should expect the same from me.

**I like action.** Long meetings where we debate potential options are often valuable, but I believe starting is the best way to begin learning and make progress. At some point, we all have to take a step to move toward a goal. I know this will annoy those who like to debate.

**Bad news does not age like fine wine.** Bubble up problems early, offer solutions. Don't sit on bad news. Transparency is critical for a highly functional, generative culture. I like status reports that highlight blockers and corrective actions with names and dates.

**I believe in the technical debt snowball effect of continually fixing small things.** Just like the old [*andon* cords](https://www.sixsigmadaily.com/what-is-an-andon-cord/) on the Toyota Production Line, fixing problems in the present will save massive time in the future. There are always bugs that can be fixed.

**I assume everyone has good intentions.** I'm also a glass half full guy and always try to find something positive when bad things happen.

**Conflict can be productive** when conflicting or differing ideas are exchanged in a way where everyone feels equally heard, respected, and unafraid to voice a dissenting opinion. We won't always agree, but my goal is to reach a mutually comfortable resolution (even if we disagree).

**I am data driven,** and prefer to debate issues with clear, valid, and observable evidence. This makes decision making orders of magnitude easier and removes guesswork. One of my favorite quotes from Apollo 13 is Ed Harris as Gene Kranz coaching his team with this statement: "Let's work the problem, people. **Let's not make things any worse by guessing.**"

## Feedback Protocol

I like feedback and coaching—--both giving and receiving. It helps to create closed-loop communication.

At < COMPANY >, there is a formal feedback cycle. We set our goals annually. I will send you information on my goals as well as expectations for what you should prepare for your goals. You will draft your goals and we will review in one of our 1:1s. Alignment is important. You should expect that your goals align with mine, which will align with our BU and company goals. While we review your goals, I’ll ask for feedback on my performance.

Review periods are not the only time we’ll exchange feedback. This will be a recurring topic in our 1:1s. I am going to ask you for feedback in 1:1s regularly. I am never going to stop doing this no matter how many times you say you have no feedback for me.

Disagreement is ok. We will learn to efficiently disagree with each other and trust and respect each other more. Ideas don’t get better when everyone is in agreement.

I expect you to hold me accountable to these principles just like I will hold you accountable to them.

## Escalation Protocol

Sometimes we will run into a brick wall when trying to accomplish a task. Over the years, I have learned a few things about how this occurs.

* **My priority may not be in line with your priority.** Things important to me may not be important to you, and vice versa. Conflict with other groups often stems from misaligned goals and priorities.
* **Escalation is not for getting your way.** However, it can be a tool to highlight broken process or organizational dysfunction that is not in line with our overall goals.

## Meeting Protocol

There is never a shortage of meetings. I can't remember a job that didn't have major demands on my calendar. I sometimes get double and triple (or worse) booked. I will also block time in the morning for me to get actual work done. I do my best work in the morning.

I believe that meetings work best when they include an agenda (or an intended purpose), an appropriate amount of productive attendees (not too many and not without key participants), and one accountable person running the meeting to a schedule. Meetings should end with clearly defined action items (what's the next step with names and dates) and communication points for participants (what did we accomplish with our time?).

When thinking about how many people to include in a meeting, remember the [Rule of Seven](https://www.bain.com/insights/decide-and-deliver/). According to Blenko, Mankins, and Rogers, every attendee over seven reduces the likelihood of making a good, quick, executable decision by 10%. Once you hit 16 or 17, your decision effectiveness is close to zero. Send your key communication points to participants and others that need to be informed (the I of RACI, see below for more info on RACI Charts) so they can review as opposed to multitask in a meeting.

I like meetings that start on time and end early enough for me to get to my next meeting on time. If I will be late, I will do my best to let you know. Sometimes meetings run long. I will try not to let that impact your meeting.

I will read materials before the meeting to prepare myself and have any questions ready. If I haven’t read the materials, I will tell you.

If a meeting completes its intended purpose before it’s scheduled to end, let's end early. If it’s clear the intended goal won’t be achieved in the allotted time, let’s stop the meeting before time is up and determine how to finish the meeting later.

## My Favorite Status Report

Status reports should be easy to consume on any device, quickly communicate wins and blockers, and ensure everyone who needs to know is included. I prefer to do these over email or messenger, as long as all the correct people can easily see it and act on it. It should be text-based, color-coded, and easily consumable on a laptop, tablet, or phone.

General rules:
* Every meeting on the topic should generate at least one line of text in the report.
* Tag (@) anyone who is mentioned in the report.
* Completed steps should move the project forward. Setting up a future meeting does not meet this criteria.
* Highlight any upcoming deadlines (within 7 days) and tag (@) the responsible delivery person.
* Use colors to highlight good and bad. People don't like seeing their name in red, and they will work to correct.
* The TO line should include your direct manager and anyone directly tagged in the report, the CC line should include anyone in the I part of the RACI chart, plus anyone's direct supervisor who is in the TO line.
* Use a frequency appropriate for the project. If there are a lot of moving parts that warrant a daily report, send daily. Weekly is probably sufficient.
* If using email, be sure to go into your sent items and reply to the previous report adding your new update on top. This provides context for any recipient to scroll and answer the question, "How did we end up here?"

### Layout

- Needs/Blockers:
	- Critical items first. Discuss anything you need or anything blocking you.
	- Should tag (@) people where possible and use /Red/Yellow/Highlights
- Watch Items:
	- These things will turn into needs/blockers if not closely monitored. 
	- Tag (@) any people running critical path workstreams with details/data. 
	- Include risks that may pop up like resource contention.
- Completed from previous update:
	- Add anything here that would be relevant. 
	- ACTIONS. VERIFIABLE. VISIBLE. I.e., setting up a meeting is not something you completed.
	- Include people who completed as well as any dates.
- Next Steps:
	- Here’s where you talk about the next items for the work stream.
	- If this is a big project that is near the end and you have a short list of items to complete, just list all outstanding work.
	- If this is a big project organized with multiple workstreams, highlight each one delivery by commitment.
	- Tag people who are doing the next step (@) and include dates.

## Nuance and Errata

**I am analytical**, which means that I ask lots of questions and want to understand your point of view. If you make an assertion, be prepared to back it up with data. [Weasel words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weasel_word) make me think you didn't do your research and are operating on gut instinct.

**Humans stating opinions as facts** elicit suspicion. I appreciate reputable references.

**When I ask you to do something that feels poorly defined** you should ask me to clarify. Sometimes I jump ahead without fully explaining myself. Questions can save us all time and effort (pull the *andon* cord).

**I am a planner,** and like to work backwards from end-state deliverables with actions, names, and dates. I hold people accountable to dates and do not tolerate a last minute miss. When life happens and dates need to be adjusted, communicate it early.

**I have trust issues with numbers that don't look real or don't add up,** which means that I may often ask you to show your work like your third grade math teacher did. It's not for partial credit, it's so I can understand from the bottom up.

**Ask assertive versus tell assertive.** When you need me to do something, ask me. I respond incredibly well to ask assertiveness (“Branden, can you help with < TASK >?”). I respond poorly to being told what to do (“Branden, do < TASK >”). Unless there is an imminent threat to life and property, in which case, please tell me to move!

**Sometimes I talk a lot.** It's because I get excited and love to exchange ideas. I'm learning to pause and check-in with others. When I get really excited, I sometimes swear. I don't mind some salty language, but I will avoid using it in formal settings.

**I like [RACI](https://thedigitalprojectmanager.com/raci-chart-made-simple/) charts** to help define roles and responsibilities across complex teams and silos when we all work together on a project or as part of business as usual. I love to collaborate, but only when [roles and team identity are well defined](https://hbr.org/2019/03/the-collaboration-blind-spot) to avoid counter-productive activities. I would much rather have the argument on roles and responsibilities before the first task starts.

**If I am on my phone during a meeting for more than 30 seconds, prompt me with a question.** Sometimes my attention wanders, but I can bring it back super quick.

**This document is a [living, breathing thing](https://github.com/captbrando/hackingbrando)** and is not yet complete. I will update it frequently and would appreciate your feedback.
